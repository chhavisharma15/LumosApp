            <div class="head">
            <b>How to use</b>
            </div>
            <p>Take this medication by mouth on an empty stomach (1 hour before or 2 hours after meals) as directed by your doctor. If you are using the liquid form of this medication, carefully measure the dose using a special measuring device/spoon. Do not use a household spoon because you may not get the correct dose.

                    <br>If you also take antacids that contain aluminum, take this medication at least 1 hour before the antacid.
                                
                    <br>For the best effect, take this drug at evenly spaced times. If you are taking this medication daily, take it at the same time each day. If you are taking this medication on a weekly schedule, take it on the same day(s) of the week and at the same time each day. Mark the days on the calendar when you need to take the medication.
                    
                    <br>Continue to take this medication (and other TB medications) until the full prescribed amount is finished, even if symptoms disappear. Stopping the medication too early or skipping doses may allow the bacteria to continue to grow, which may result in a return of the infection and cause the infection to be more difficult to treat (resistant).

                <br>This product may cause live bacterial vaccines (such as BCG vaccine) to not work as well. Therefore, do not have any immunizations/vaccinations while using this medication unless your doctor tells you to.
                    
                <br>Liquid forms of this medication may contain sugar. Caution is advised if you have diabetes or any other condition that requires you to limit/avoid sugar. Ask your doctor or pharmacist about using this product safely.

          <div class="head">
          <b>How to use</b>
          </div>
          <p>This medication is best taken on an empty stomach with a full glass of water (8 ounces or 240 milliliters) 1 hour before or 2 hours after meals; or take as directed by your doctor. If you have nausea, do not take antacids with rifampin since it will lessen the effectiveness of this drug. However, if you need to take antacids, wait at least 1 hour after taking this drug.

              <br>If you are unable to swallow the capsules, you may open the capsule and sprinkle the contents onto a spoonful of cool, soft applesauce or jelly. Eat the entire mixture right away. Do not prepare a supply for future use.
                
              <br>If you have a liquid form, shake the bottle well before each dose. Use a medication-measuring device to carefully measure the prescribed dose.          </p>

          <div class="head">
              <b>Side Effects</b>
              </div>

              <br>This medication may produce a harmless, reddish coloration of urine, sweat, saliva, or tears. Soft contact lenses may be permanently stained.
                
                Ri<br>fampin may rarely cause serious liver disease. Though sometimes necessary to completely treat certain infections, combination treatment with other drugs (e.g., isoniazid, pyrazinamide) may increase this risk. Tell your doctor right away if any of these unlikely but serious side effects occur: signs of kidney problems (such as change in the amount of urine), persistent nausea/vomiting, stomach/abdominal pain, dark urine, yellowing eyes/skin, mental/mood changes (e.g., confusion, unusual behavior), unusual tiredness, easy bruising/bleeding, small red spots on the skin, joint pain/swelling.
                
                <br>This medication may rarely cause a severe intestinal condition (Clostridium difficile-associated diarrhea) due to a type of resistant bacteria. This condition may occur during treatment or weeks to months after treatment has stopped. Do not use anti-diarrhea products or narcotic pain medications if you have any of the following symptoms because these products may make them worse. Tell your doctor right away if you develop: persistent diarrhea, abdominal or stomach pain/cramping, blood/mucus in your stool.
                
                <br>Use of this medication for prolonged or repeated periods may result in oral thrush or a new yeast infection (oral/vaginal fungal infection). Contact your doctor if you notice white patches in your mouth, a change in vaginal discharge, or other new symptoms.
                
                <br>A very serious allergic reaction to this drug is rare. However, get medical help right away if you notice any symptoms of a serious allergic reaction, including: fever that doesn't go away, new or worsening lymph node swelling, rash, itching/swelling (especially of the face/tongue/throat), severe dizziness, trouble breathing.</p>

              <b>Precautions</b>
              </div>
          <p>This drug may make you dizzy or drowsy. Do not drive, use machinery, or do any activity that requires alertness until you are sure you can perform such activities safely. Limit alcoholic beverages.

              <br>Rifampin may cause live bacterial vaccines (such as typhoid vaccine) to not work as well. Do not have any immunizations/vaccinations while using this medication unless your doctor tells you to.
                
              <br>Before having surgery, tell your doctor or dentist that you are using this drug.
                
              <br>During pregnancy, this medication should be used only when clearly needed. When this drug is taken during the last few weeks of pregnancy, the risk of bleeding in both mother and infant may be increased. Tell your doctor right away if you notice any bleeding in your newborn. Discuss the risks and benefits with your doctor.
                
                Rifampin passes into breast milk but is unlikely to harm a nursing infant. Consult your doctor before breast-feeding.</p>
